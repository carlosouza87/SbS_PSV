# SbS_PSV
MATLAB-based simulator for side-by-side operations with a dinamicaly positioned Platform Supply Vessel (PSV) and a platform.
This is a program written in MATLAB language for simulating side-by-side operations between a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV) and a platform (e.g. and FPSO).
Input data (WAMIT files) shall be provided by the user and processed with the "Input generator", which will provide MATLAB binary files for the simulation.
The m-file "main.m" shall then be executed as for the simulation to be carried out.
